I'm interested in some modding for some games like - 
`Rimworld`, 
`Rusted Warfare`, 
`Reassembly` 
and maybe `Minecraf`t and `Starsector`(probably not going for these two anytime soon), 
mainly in C#/Java or xml/lua/json if present.
I also like networking a bit.

I speak Russian and English mostly. You can contact me via discord server linked in profile
