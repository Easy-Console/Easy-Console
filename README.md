I'm interested in some modding for some games like -
`Rimworld`
`Rusted Warfare`
`Reassembly`
And maybe `Minecraf`t and `Starsector`(probably not going for these two anytime soon)
Mainly in C#/Java or xml/lua/json if present.
I also like networking a bit.

I speak Russian and English mostly. You can contact me via discord server linked in profile
